Project Description
The website aims to empower individuals by providing the tools and information they need to make educated career decisions and succeed inÂ theÂ jobÂ market for people who are confused about their future plans.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
This is not a problem faced by all but it is definitely a problem for someone who is multitalented and confused about following their passion or future academics. 

 The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Our vision was to guide students and give them a matching job according to their personality or interest.
Even if nobody asked for a solution, It was definitely a need  in our case back then ,  unfortunately there wasnt any.
So from our experience we thought that there are many people who face this problem .
So we addressed this problem so that no one in the future should face such a situation.
